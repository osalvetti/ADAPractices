    <h2>Life and career</h2>
        <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,
           [7] the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. 
           His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. 
           Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, 
           "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".[8]

        <p>Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 1996,[9] graduating with a master's degree in computer science from the NODES research group.
           [10] His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the Finnish Navy Nyland Brigade in the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland. 
           He gained the rank of second lieutenant, with the role of an artillery observer.[11] 
           Torvalds bought computer science professor Andrew Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an educational stripped-down version of Unix. 
           In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed to Unix for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX.[12] His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.[13]</p>    
    <h3>Personal life</h3>
        <p>Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (née Monni)—a six-time Finnish national karate champion—whom he first met in late 1993. 
           Linus was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, 
           to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.[8] Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, 
           two of whom were born in the United States.[51] The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) 
           as magic values.[52][53]</p>
        <p>Torvalds has described himself as "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. 
           I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. 
           I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in the United States it has become very politicized. 
           When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion."[54] In a story about the March LinuxWorld Conference titled "Linus the Liberator", 
           Torvalds is quoted as saying "There are like two golden rules in life. One is 'Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.' For some reason, people associate this with Christianity. I'm not a Christian. I'm agnostic. The other rule is 'Be proud of what you do.'"[55]</p>
